AKW-Simulator
=============

A simulation game - run the nuclear power plant!


##What is this?
Back then, I was bored and needed something to work on while transitioning from Pascal to object oriented languages. I am fascinated by simulation games and this is how this program was born.

##Why did you open-source it?
The original release was done via my former website (www.fssnet-n.de; shutdown) and a popular german C# forum (thread: http://www.mycsharp.de/wbb2/thread.php?postid=323500). Sources were not included. However, a few poeple asked for them and I delivered, but in a private manner. Since with Github the lack of a decent source code sharing platform has been overcome, why not publish it here?!

##Warning!
I wrote this as a complete OO n00b. Program structure is incredible awful, comments are rare and in german and I should be ashamed to publish that kind of code. So: If you are interested in low-skill programming (and want to learn how things are not done), take a look at the source code, otherwise just play it.
Also, please note that the there is no localization (german ONLY)

##What about the Highscore?
The backend server was shut down a long time ago, so the highscore, news and autoupdate capability isn't available anymore. However, the last Highscore dump is available on this page. 

##What kind of project is it?
It's a C# Visual Studio 2008 solution, binaries compiled for .Net 2.0

##Where to go from here?
I'm aware of a few minor bugs but currently, I'm not planning to make improvements to the simulator. However, feel free to fork it ;)
